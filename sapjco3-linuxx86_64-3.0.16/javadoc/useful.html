<b>Components of the SAP Java Connector</b>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
    The SAP Java Connector 3.0 runtime environment consists of 2 parts:
    <ul>
        <li>sapjco3.jar - The archive containing JCo's Java runtime classes
        <li>{library prefix}sapjco3{shared library extension} - The JNI library containing
            JCo's native code
    </ul>

    JCo's JNI library contains the native code for the network communication. There is only a loose
    coupling between the JCo archive and the JNI library, however JCo needs a specific minimum version
    of the JNI library which is usually the one being shipped together with the JCo archive in the
    distribution package.<br>
    <br>
    <em>Note:</em> If you are using a 32-bit JVM you will also need the 32-bit JCo JNI library,
    regardless if you are running on a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system.

<b>Runtime initialization</b>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
    When an application references a JCo class for the first time it will be loaded by the associated
    class loader. During this process JCo's static initializer will be executed. This routine will
    search and load the JCo JNI library by using the following algorithm:<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Try to load the sapjco3 JNI library from the same directory where the
            <code>sapjco3.jar</code> file resides.<br>

        <li>Try to load the sapjco3 JNI library from a platform dependent subdirectory where the
            <code>sapjco3.jar</code> file resides. The appropriate JNI library loading path is
            determined by considering the currently used operating system and JVM runtime environment
            and refers to one of the following subdirectories:<br>
            <code>ntamd64, ntintel, ntia64, linuxx86_64, linuxintel, linuxppc64, linuxppc64le, linuxia64,
            linuxs390x, darwinintel64, darwinintel, rs6000_64, hpia64, hp_64, sunx86_64, sun_64, os390_64,
            as400_pase_64</code><br>

        <li>Search the sapjco3 JNI library along the directory path defined in the
            <code>java.library.path</code> system property from left to right, and if found load
            it from there.<br>
            <em>Note:</em> If this property is not set manually, the JVM will usually set the OS specific
            library path environment variable as the default <code>java.library.path</code> system
            property at startup.<br>

        <li>Let the JVM handle the loading of the sapjco3 JNI library by delegating
            this task to its <code>System.loadLibrary(String libname)</code> method.
    </ol>
    If the sapjco3 JNI library cannot be found or loaded, you will get an <code>UnsatisfiedLinkError</code>
    with details provided from the operating system.<br>
    This error message may be caused for one of the following reasons:
    <ul>
        <li>The sapjco3 JNI library cannot be found by using the above described
            algorithm, because you unintentionally installed it to the wrong directory or forgot
            to specify its directory in the OS specific library path environment variable or alternatively
            in the <code>java.library.path</code> system property.
        <li>The version of the found sapjco3 JNI library is too old.
        <li>The found sapjco3 JNI library lacks the execute permission flag.
        <li>The found sapjco3 JNI library does not have the same bit width as the JVM (32-bit vs. 64-bit).
        <li>The found sapjco3 JNI library is from a different JCo distribution and is not for use with
            your operating system and/or your hardware processor.
        <li>The found sapjco3 JNI library requires a higher operating system version.
    </ul>

    Please note that JCo sometimes investigates the call stack and hence needs stack traces for working
    properly.<br>
    Hence, the JVM special option <code>-XX:-StackTraceInThrowable</code> cannot be used.

<b>Version dialog / Smoke installation test</b>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
    You can check if JCo is installed correctly by starting its About dialog. This can conveniently be done
    by using the command<br>
    <br>
       <code>&nbsp; &nbsp;java -jar {sapjco3-path}/sapjco3.jar</code><br>
    or<br>
       <code>&nbsp; &nbsp;java -classpath {sapjco3-path}/sapjco3.jar com.sap.conn.jco.rt.About</code><br>
	<br>
    The command will pop up a dialog containing all relevant JCo version information. On non-windowing systems
    you can get the same information printed to the console by typing<br>
    <br>
       <code>&nbsp; &nbsp;java -jar {sapjco3-path}/sapjco3.jar -stdout &nbsp;[-noManifest | -noDigests]</code><br>
    or<br>
       <code>&nbsp; &nbsp;java -classpath {sapjco3-path}/sapjco3.jar com.sap.conn.jco.rt.About -stdout &nbsp;[-noManifest | -noDigests]</code><br>
    <br>
    There should be no exception or error thrown and all versions should be listed with their correct version
    numbers and date. Otherwise please see the above chapter "Runtime initialization" for possible installation
    or configuration errors.

<b>Network configuration</b>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
    JCo uses the CPI-C protocol based on TCP/IP for its low level network communication. Usually the TCP/IP protocol is a
    communication service provided by the operating system. So, as a prerequisite for JCo to work, the TCP/IP
    service must be configured.<br>
    If you have a working SAPGUI installed on your machine all necessary TCP/IP configuration steps should have
    been already made during its installation process. But if you install JCo from scratch on a new system, you
    have to take care of the following:<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure that the SAP application, message and gateway servers or alternatively the SAP router
            can be reached physically by using their IP addresses (<code>ping&nbsp;&lt;nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn&gt;</code>).
            If this won't work please ask your network administrator for help.
        <li>If desired, make sure that the SAP application, message and gateway servers or alternatively the SAP
            router can also be reached by using their logical host names (<code>ping&nbsp;&lt;hostname&gt;</code>).
            If they cannot be reached this way please check your DNS (Domain Name Service) entries or maintain
            the respective host name in your local hosts file (for Windows systems:
            <code>&lt;WinDir&gt;\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</code>).
        <li>If you would like to use the load balanced log on, check if the SAP message server service and its
            TCP port is defined in the services file. There must be an entry of format <code>"sapms&lt;SID&gt;&nbsp;&lt;portnumber&gt;/tcp"</code>
            in the services file where <code>&lt;SID&gt;</code> = 3-letter SAP System ID. (In Windows systems the
            services file is usually stored at <code>&lt;WinDir&gt;\system32\drivers\etc\services</code>)
    </ul>
    For more information on the SAP technical infrastructure, network communication and configuration please have a
    look at SAP Note <a href="https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/21151">21151</a>.

<b>Application configuration for Unicode SAP Systems</b>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
    If you would like to do RFC outbound calls from a Unicode SAP System to a JCoServer instance,
    you have to set the &nbsp;"Unicode"&nbsp; option for your RFC destination in transaction <code>SM59</code>.
    This option can be found on the Tab "Unicode" or "MDMP & Unicode", section "Communication Type with Target
    System" (for releases 7.00 and higher), or on the Tab "Special Options", section "Character Width in Target
    System" (for releases 6.10 to 6.40).<br><br>
    For RFC outbound calls from a non-Unicode SAP System to a JCoServer instance or for any inbound
    RFC calls to non-Unicode or Unicode SAP Systems you don't have to do any special configuration tasks.

<b>Tracing mechanisms</b>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
    JCo's tracing mechanism can be turned on by setting the following java environment
    properties at startup:<br>
    <br>
       <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Djco.trace_level=N&nbsp;(where 0 &le; N &le; 10 with 10 = most detailed trace)</code><br><br>
    and optionally<br>
    <br>
       <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Djco.trace_path=&lt;PATH&gt;</code><br>
    <br>
    If a trace path is set, the JCo traces will be written to one or multiple files named
    <code>JCO&lt;date&gt;_&lt;time&gt;.&lt;n&gt;.trc</code> in the specified <code>PATH</code> directory. Otherwise the JCo
    traces will be written to the standard output stream (default is an output to the console).<br>
    The same tracing behavior can be achieved by modifying the program code calling the JCo API
    <code>JCo.setTrace(int level, String path)</code>.<p>

    The tracing mechanism of the lower RFC layer can be turned on by setting the following java environment property at startup:<br><br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Djrfc.trace=1</code><br><br>
    Please note that in this case <i><b>all</b></i> connections will be traced, hence this should be only the last resort.<br><br>
    The RFC layer trace files are named <code>jco_rfc&lt;processID&gt;_&lt;threadID&gt;.&lt;n&gt;.trc</code>
    and will be written to the current working directory, or to the path that is specified by <code>jco.trace_path</code>.
    If you would like to trace particular RFC connections only, you can turn on the RFC layer tracing specifically by setting
    <code>jco.client.trace=1</code> in the appropriate <code>JCoDestination</code> or <code>jco.server.trace=1</code> in the
    appropriate <code>JCoServer</code> configuration properties.<br><br>
    The RFC error log file <code>dev_jco_rfc.trc</code> that can be found in the same directory is created independently from
    any trace setting. RFC errors will always be logged in this file.
